I am a motivated and passionate data scientist who enjoys using machine learning and artificial intelligence to real-world challenges. I have a good foundation in both theoretical and practical parts of these subjects, currently I am joining industry-led, supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia, [Bangkit 2023, led by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka](https://bangkit.academy), and I have a track record of providing high-quality results through solo learning as well as cooperation with others. When I'm not working, you can find me actively competing in data science contests, developing my abilities and staying up to date on the newest advances in the industry. My ultimate objective is to use my experience to make a good effect and encourage industry innovation.

I love watching movies and analyzing every aspect of it. Also, I sometimes read science books (check out my Goodreads profile).
