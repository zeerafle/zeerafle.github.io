# Dilkush: AI-Powered Language Learning Workspace

A Vue.js web application that transforms YouTube videos into interactive language learning experiences using Google's Gemini API.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Dilkush** is a language learning platform designed to streamline Turkish exam preparation by automatically generating listening comprehension questions from YouTube videos. What started as a manual process of downloading videos, transcribing them through third-party services, and manually creating questions with ChatGPT, evolved into an automated, intelligent workspace.

**Live Demo:** [https://dilkush.web.app](https://dilkush.web.app)

## 🚀 Key Features

- **YouTube Video Processing**: Direct URL input for automatic question generation
- **Interactive Learning**: Answer questions and receive instant feedback
- **Adaptive Reading Materials**: Search and adjust content based on proficiency level (e.g., B2)
- **Exam Preparation Focus**: Designed specifically for Turkish language certification tests

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Backend**: Firebase
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for video understanding
- **Framework**: Firebase Genkit for serverless functions

## 💡 The Problem & Solution

**Challenge**: Traditional language exam preparation required a multi-step manual process:
1. Download YouTube videos
2. Upload to transcription services (Speechmatics, ElevenLabs)
3. Copy transcripts to ChatGPT with custom prompts
4. Manually format questions

**Solution**: Leveraged Google Gemini's native YouTube video understanding capabilities to automate the entire workflow through a single URL input.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- **Writing Module**: AI-powered writing exercises and feedback
- **Speaking Assessment**: Voice recognition and pronunciation evaluation
- **Cultural Content**: Turkish idioms, proverbs, and cultural references
- **Comprehensive Exam Simulation**: Full Turkish proficiency test experience

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to explore:
- Google Gemini API's multimodal capabilities
- Firebase Genkit framework (first-time implementation)
- Vue.js frontend development
- AI-driven educational tool design
